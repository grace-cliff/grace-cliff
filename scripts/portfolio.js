I want to change the concept of how one should look by redirecting the focus to athleticism and health. There is no one ‘dancer body’. The imagery of a long neck, small waist, and long legs that Ballenchine instilled in dance leads to unhealthy and unrealistic expectations that most dancers can not obtain. Yes, some dancers can maintain this body and be healthy but that should not be the standard. This topic brings attention to a subject that is still rarely talked about in the ballet/dance community. I have personal experiences relating to this subject having danced my whole life and being immersed in studio dance and college dance. This piece is broken down into three sections with the first section tying the pointe shoes, a performance, and concluding with the pointe shoes being untied. Audio of prominent dancers play including Misty Copeland, Kathryn Morgan, and Luna Montana. Body image is discussed while tying and untying the pointe shoes symbolizing the thoughts that go through a dancer’s mind before and after a show. One piece that inspired me was ‘How we experience time and memory through art: Sarah Sze Interview’ through the specific objects I chose to include in the performance art. In regards to the space, a curtain is draped with a single industrial light casted over my body. I wanted this to allude to the backstage of a theatre where a dancer would quickly change before performing on stage. The way the curtain is draped is similar to the classical era just as ballet’s origin is during the classical era. Most of my body sits in shadow with a rather somber mood. In an interview, Sarah Sze talks about objects occupying spaces in the form of memory. I wanted to create a space that held memories of past performances. Another inspiration is ‘The Case for Performance Art (The Art Assignment)’ The piece is not about the dancing but the emotional cost that comes with being a dancer.",

While the train burned and pumped clouds of thick black smoke into the air, the media coverage of the disaster was absent. Little to no word is getting publicized about this environmental catastrophe. Our exhibition confronts censorship at its target destination: the public. In making this exhibition, we, (Alex Morgan, Angelo Mendez, Benson, Grace Cliff, and Tess McBride), hope to bring to light the many forms of censorship still present in America today. This is a censored exhibition. The content of our work is confined by the content available to us. Our exhibition is a product of the little amount that we know. MassArt Studio Foundation Brant Gallery in Boston exhibited visual material from This is a Censored Exhibition in their show titled Energy: A Closer Look.",

            info_1: "“Expectations versus Reality” challenges one’s predisposed notions of reality. This surrealistic and DADA inspired multimedia work incorporates visual and sound pairings that initiates questions about the phenomenon we live in. For example, when cutting a melon one would expect fruit inside but what if that is not the case. In the history of surrealism, pieces are based on the subconscious mind and do not make logical sense just as this piece does not follow linear thinking. This piece reflects surrealism with ambiguity towards time and exaggerated color. Themes of DADA are shown through playfulness, layered ideas, and avant-garde concepts. Artist Mika Rottenberg I first drew inspiration from in her video “Spaghetti Blockchain” when I attended her exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. I was also influenced by the episode “Identity” by Art of the 21st Century Season 1 when Steve Martin sets the scene. Finally, the music videos ‘Locket’ and ‘M.R.’ for the band “Crumb” inspired me as well as ASMR videos.",
